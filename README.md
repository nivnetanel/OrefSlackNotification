## 🎧 Audio Preview

You can preview the calm alert sound (`flash.mp3`) directly from the site using the built-in HTML audio player.

## 📦 APK Download

The APK is available for direct download on the site:
- `oref-slack.apk` — Calm Sound Version

## 🌐 Language Support

The website supports both:
- 🇮🇱 **Hebrew** (RTL)
- 🇬🇧 **English** (LTR)

Users can toggle language with the built-in button.
